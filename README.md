## Description

This is a basic practice webpage that allows two players play Pig Dice with each other. The rules of Pig Dice are as follows:

* _Player rolls two dice._
* _If one of the dice is a one, the player's turn is over and they receive no points._
* _If both of the dice are ones, the player's total score is reset to zero and their turn is over._
* _Otherwise, the total of the two dice is added to the turn score._
* _At any point the player can "Hold" and their turn score is added to their total score._
* _First player to 100 wins._
